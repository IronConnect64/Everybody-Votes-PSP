# Everybody Votes PSP

A novelty poll game inspired by Everybody Votes Channel for Wii.

The premise of the program is that PSP and PS Vita users will be able to vote on polls posted to the server. The game will feature numerous improvements over the currently available offerings for Everybody Votes Channel, including:

- Authentication/checks to ensure only real PSP users are voting
- A range of questions that include real brands and questions previously asked on Nintendo's Everybody Votes Channel during its official operation, brought to a new audience!
- And more!
